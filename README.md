# Haptic-Feedback-Robot-Controller---Master-Thesis
This is the Master Thesis written by Roman Oechslin at University of Tokyo in 2018.

The project consits of designing a cotroller that is able to navigate a robot and gives feedback by using palm pressurization. The actuation system is based on a series elastic actuator design and the prototypes have been developed and tested at the University of Tokyo.

For testing purposes the robot developed by TOPY has been used.
